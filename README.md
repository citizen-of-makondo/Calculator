Hello everyone.
My name is Alex and I have started learning to write code and create mobile app for Android. I'm learning in online university Geekbrains.

I want to be a good developer, working in a big IT-company (maybe, international). 
If you see my code and want to write me your comment - you can text me e-mail: a_v_ilinskiy@outlook.com, I'm glad to read every letter. 

This is my first app - Calculator. 
I regret that every junior developer have to create their personal calculator, hello world and other easy projects. You can show your skills and see later how you grew up.
